Introduction
===
If you've ever used the EyeWitness tool to analyze web applications (request and responses) and to take screenshots, this tool basically takes the HTML reports and convert them over to a text file. It's most useful for when you want to browse through the applications based on their titles. For example, if there's 900 web applications, by organizing the titles, you'll be able to efficiently go through the applications and assess only a sample of the applications that are similar (e.g. 30 of 300 same printers, etc).

Instructions
===
Place this ruby file in the directory that contains the HTML reports, and simply run it afterwards:
<pre><code>

</code></pre>
