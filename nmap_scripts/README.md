Introduction
===
These Nmap scripts were created to make parsing Nmap files much more convenient. For example, with <code>nmap_parser.py</code>, it simply creates a text file, named whatever port that was found to be opened, and it contains a list of IP addresses that has that port open. It's much easier to feed other tools a list of IP addresses that have a port opened this way.

With the <code>nmapscrape.rb</code> script, this allows for you to parse a greppable Nmap output into a nicely formatted table.
